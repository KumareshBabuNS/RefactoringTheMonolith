= Refactoring the Monolith: LIVE!

[abstract]
--
Many of us would love to embrace microservices in our day-to-day work. But most of us don’t have the opportunity to start over with a pure greenfield effort. We have to understand how to refactor our existing monolithic applications toward microservices. Practical steps include building new features as microservices, leveraging anti-corruption layers, strangling the monolith.

In this presentation we’ll go light on the theory and walk through the actual process of turning a strawman monolith into a family of well-factored microservices.
